# SWP-data_analysis
This process standardizes the phenotyping of wound-induced electric signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana plants.

The 3D printable parts (WoundingTeeth.stl) standardize the wounding stimulus, maximizing the response triggering probability.

The R script is designed for high-throughput importing, managing, plotting and analysing extracellular electric recordings of wound-induced Slow Wave Potentials.

The code is organized as a R notebook, and runs in chunks. 
Open SWPanalyzer.Rmd in RStudio and follow the instructions.

NOTE:
Details on the data structure of input and output is described for every step in the R notebook (SWPanalyzer.Rmd). 
Given the high-throughput nature of the script, and the unknown distribution of your resulting data, final plots and STATISTICS ARE JUST A GUIDE and MUST be doubled checked manually.
